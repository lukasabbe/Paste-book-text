**Are you tired of painstakingly cutting up your texts in order for them to fit in Minecraft books? Look no further!**
# Seamless paste ability

Pressing `Ctrl + V` is no longer limited to one page! Simply copy your text, paste it and watch as the mod does the rest!

## Features

- Paste across pages
- Does not split words in half, new pages will only be added between words!

# 1.21.6?
So right now the whole book system has been rewriten, so this update will take a bit longer than the normal sadly.
